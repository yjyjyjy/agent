300,"Great question Marina! I think that technology is making a revolution not only in the way we learn -or even are ""necessary"" as human beings- but only in the political and power system: to whom we confer authority and why?. I think self-conscious people, with a critical mind and self-discipline values and desire to get better, will always defend their rights to speak by themselves, and think by themselves. Technology doesn´t replace our right to think by ourselves. I think that smart self conscious people will always want to learn and acquire foreign languages by themselves to expand their horizons and consciousness. Maybe with the help -assistance of technlogy as a training tool-, never replacing the ability to think by themselves and learning from other human beings. We human beings create the language, and we are the ones that make them evolve, technology is only a tool. But that said, for those people that are lazy, don't care to think by themselves, and blindly trust technology, well, yes, they are just going to use apps. The other people, we are going to continue exercising our brains, imagination and emotions.",1,Questions

313,"Please read this 🙏
The Israeli occupation, a fact even acknowledged by Israelis, traces back to 1948 when the Balfour Declaration of 1917 pledged support for a Jewish national home in Palestine. This historical context is essential to understanding the plight of Palestinians. For over 70 years, Palestinians have endured displacement, restricted movement, and lived under harsh conditions. The term “apartheid” aptly describes the segregation and discrimination they face in their own land, marked by numerous Israeli checkpoints. Despite countless peaceful attempts, oppression persists, leading to further land loss and human suffering. It’s important to note that Hamas, often a focus of international attention, emerged as a response to active resistance against this enduring injustice. If you trying to feel sorry for Israelis today I hope you felt sorry for Palestinians for the past 70 years 🇵🇸🙏. Give the people their homes and country back.🇵🇸🙏",1,New Subscriber

722,"You’re right, once you have a basic command of the language, grammar is best learnt in context, by listening to speech and reading texts. Obviously choose input that is of an appropriate level, or a little bit higher. I’m English, but I cannot explain English grammar, and things like the subjunctive are a mystery to me. Often if I startbto think about a phrase I use, I realise that it doesn’t make sense except as a whole. I might do something in a piecemeal fashion. But why piecemeal? What a weird meaningless word. Or I give someone a leg up. What? I arrived in time. Why in time? I just know the meaning of in and time together.",1,Questions

all you need to do is say the Shahada, which is a declaration of faith: Ashhado Anna la ilah illa ALLAH wa ana Muhammad Rassoul ALLH.

864,"A message to every foreigner who does not know the Palestinian issue.  I wanted to talk about it.  When the First World War broke out, the Zionist entity was hated by the Germans, so they went to Palestine because it was the most peaceful country.  Palestine welcomed them, and after a while they went to the Zionists, telling us that we want our rights, that they wanted to make their own land on Palestinian land, and the Palestinians said it.  This is our land, we cannot give it to you, so they took advantage of the fact that there were a large number of them in Palestine, so they started a war and occupied it.  I imagine that you are helping someone and leaving you and taking your land.  Try to search for Palestine.  God willing, you will benefit.  I am an Arab and I am 14 years old.

Maybe, for some of us my English is not enough but as you said Marina Who cares about it ?, I'm the boss here  and Frankly I don't mind in general. I stopped thinking about my accent and decided to focus on my target. to make a long story short if you are learning in English improve yourself or to reach your aim , you need to work hard , Your videos helped me improve my English because your positive energy is mind-blowing  and directly effect people who really need that❤",1,Positive Feedback

1314,"C1 first question... ""I will usually go for a short walk before going to bed.""

The sentence is correct, but it is a bit unusual to use the future tense (""will"") to talk about a habit that you usually do. It would be more natural to say ""I usually go for a short walk before going to bed.""
The only reason you might use the future tense in this context would be if you were making a promise or a commitment to someone. For example, if you were talking to your doctor about improving your sleep habits, you might say ""I will usually go for a short walk before going to bed.""
But in general, it is more natural to use the present tense when talking about your habits.",1,Questions

2015,"To speak English quickly and understand natives better:

1. **Practice Regularly:** Consistent practice is key. Engage in daily conversations, read, and listen to English content.

2. **Immerse Yourself:** Surround yourself with English media – movies, TV shows, podcasts. This helps you get used to the speed and nuances of native speech.

3. **Listen Actively:** Pay attention to how native speakers articulate words, their intonation, and rhythm. Mimic their speech patterns.

4. **Expand Vocabulary:** A rich vocabulary enhances understanding. Learn new words daily and try to use them in sentences.

5. **Speak with Natives:** Engage in conversations with native speakers whenever possible. This helps you adapt to their pace and pronunciation.

6. **Use Slang and Idioms:** Familiarize yourself with common slang and idiomatic expressions. Natives often use these in casual conversations.

7. **Watch Your Pace:** While speed is important, clarity is crucial. Find a balance between speaking quickly and enunciating clearly.

8. **Practice Pronunciation:** Work on your pronunciation regularly. Use online tools or language apps to fine-tune your accent.

9. **Join Language Groups:** Online language exchange platforms or local meetups can provide opportunities to practice with native speakers.

10. **Ask for Feedback:** Seek feedback from native speakers or language tutors. Constructive criticism can help you identify areas for improvement.

Remember, it's a gradual process, and consistency is key.",1,Constructive Criticism

2753,I learn whole sentences saying them aloud. 5 days - 300 repetitions per day at least. Later I don't need to translate. I know the meaning of words straight away like in my native language. And also I remember the meaning longer than by learning separate words. This method is called: chunking. It was a real game changer in my learning process and communication skills in English and other languages.,1,New Subscriber

2788,"I have been unemployed for 3+ years after college (2020)  I applied for jobs like customer service, data entry operator, assistant teacher, and bakery shop staff, secretary operator none of the companies selected me it was because my English speaking was weak made me anxious thought how come my English must be bad if I have studied English medium school for 12 years I spent my half-life just a waste of time. It is devastating seeing people around me achieving their goals but I am all the way below and that made me give up. I can't express my feelings to my surroundings because somehow those people would gossip about my weakness and would talk behind my back. Then a year ago I imagined myself being dressed like a supermodel I thought about what would happen if I became an actress then something came to my earlier school years I acted once as a grandma on the theatre stage in my own mother tongue where all my friends and the audience were happy to see my wonderful act performance on the stage  that I have shown them my parents friend came up to me with lots of ""wow my girl you did an amazing job there"" thanks to all my teachers who helped me that day❤, now I feel  I want to become an international actress working in Hollywood industries when I think of it, I feel worried about  my accent in English, my race, and my physique not making it through that when negative thoughts come to me for not being what is meant for me and that's where it stops me keeps me behind, I don't want become popular or have tons of worth properties or money, i just want to help myself and if that helped me i would love  to help everyone welcoming  everyone that its okay you have got to accept the pain in good way like not giving up yourself thank for this wonderful video love your content
