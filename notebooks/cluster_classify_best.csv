27,"Great question Marina! I think that technology is making a revolution not only in the way we learn -or even are ""necessary"" as human beings- but only in the political and power system: to whom we confer authority and why?. I think self-conscious people, with a critical mind and self-discipline values and desire to get better, will always defend their rights to speak by themselves, and think by themselves. Technology doesn´t replace our right to think by ourselves. I think that smart self conscious people will always want to learn and acquire foreign languages by themselves to expand their horizons and consciousness. Maybe with the help -assistance of technlogy as a training tool-, never replacing the ability to think by themselves and learning from other human beings. We human beings create the language, and we are the ones that make them evolve, technology is only a tool. But that said, for those people that are lazy, don't care to think by themselves, and blindly trust technology, well, yes, they are just going to use apps. The other people, we are going to continue exercising our brains, imagination and emotions.",Questions,1

30,"Please read this 🙏
The Israeli occupation, a fact even acknowledged by Israelis, traces back to 1948 when the Balfour Declaration of 1917 pledged support for a Jewish national home in Palestine. This historical context is essential to understanding the plight of Palestinians. For over 70 years, Palestinians have endured displacement, restricted movement, and lived under harsh conditions. The term “apartheid” aptly describes the segregation and discrimination they face in their own land, marked by numerous Israeli checkpoints. Despite countless peaceful attempts, oppression persists, leading to further land loss and human suffering. It’s important to note that Hamas, often a focus of international attention, emerged as a response to active resistance against this enduring injustice. If you trying to feel sorry for Israelis today I hope you felt sorry for Palestinians for the past 70 years 🇵🇸🙏. Give the people their homes and country back.🇵🇸🙏",New Subscriber,1

87,"You’re right, once you have a basic command of the language, grammar is best learnt in context, by listening to speech and reading texts. Obviously choose input that is of an appropriate level, or a little bit higher. I’m English, but I cannot explain English grammar, and things like the subjunctive are a mystery to me. Often if I startbto think about a phrase I use, I realise that it doesn’t make sense except as a whole. I might do something in a piecemeal fashion. But why piecemeal? What a weird meaningless word. Or I give someone a leg up. What? I arrived in time. Why in time? I just know the meaning of in and time together.",Questions,1

""I want the best for you, my friend. I'm worried that you could end up in hell if you don't turn to Allah (the only GOD)and His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him)
 So let me  invite you  to Islam that  teaches that there is only one God, Allah, and that Muhammad is his last prophet.   
all you need to do is say the Shahada, which is a declaration of faith: Ashhado Anna la ilah illa ALLAH wa ana Muhammad Rassoul ALLH.

114,"A message to every foreigner who does not know the Palestinian issue.  I wanted to talk about it.  When the First World War broke out, the Zionist entity was hated by the Germans, so they went to Palestine because it was the most peaceful country.  Palestine welcomed them, and after a while they went to the Zionists, telling us that we want our rights, that they wanted to make their own land on Palestinian land, and the Palestinians said it.  This is our land, we cannot give it to you, so they took advantage of the fact that there were a large number of them in Palestine, so they started a war and occupied it.  I imagine that you are helping someone and leaving you and taking your land.  Try to search for Palestine.  God willing, you will benefit.  I am an Arab and I am 14 years old.

122,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:
01:39 🧠 Relate new words to yourself for better memorization.
02:09 ✏️ When encountering newwords in books or movies, write down only those that relate to you or that you've heard before but still don't know.
05:11 🏠 Create a memory palace or space with flashcards to associate new words with objects or concepts, aiding memorization.
07:35 📚 Avoid translating words on flashcards; instead, write explanations in English for better long-term retention.
09:25 🧠 Use the ""90 second method"" to repeat phrases seven to nine times for improved memorization and long-term retention.
11:17 📖 Incorporate new words into stories or diary entries to practice and remember them effectively.
12:59 📝 Place post-it notes with new words on objects you see daily to reinforce your memory.
13:41 📚 Space your learning and focus on 3-5 new words a day for more effective vocabulary acquisition.",Positive Feedback,1
