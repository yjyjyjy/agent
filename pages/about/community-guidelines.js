          <h3>The Yuzu Community</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Yuzu strives to be a community in which all Users can express themselves openly and in which they can engage in free, open communications about whatever subjects they choose. The Platform is provided to showcase content and creativity of all kinds so that Users can enjoy diverse and wide-ranging material. However, in order to make that possible it is necessary for all Users to conduct themselves in a way that is respectful, honest and fair.
            </li>
            <li>
              These Community Guidelines set out Open Insight, Inc's standards of conduct for using any of our Services. By using the Platform you are agreeing and undertaking to respect both the letter and spirit of these rules. These rules apply to the use of any Service offered on or via the Platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may change these Community Guidelines at any time without notice. Any such changes shall take effect on the next occasion that you make use of the Platform. Any such new rules may be displayed on-screen when you next use the Platform, and you may be required to read and accept them in order to continue your use of the Platform. However, it is your responsibility to check these Community Guidelines before each use of the Platform and to make yourself aware of any changes. For ease of reference the top of these guidelines indicates the date on which they were last updated.

          <h3>Content Guidelines</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Users must have the legal right to post any User Content which they upload to the Platform, either by way of being the owner of the relevant rights or being in possession of a valid licence which entitles them to upload that content to the Platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              User Content must not:
              <ul>
                <li>infringe or violate the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party, including other Users;</li>
                <li>
                  violate the local laws of the jurisdiction from which the relevant User is accessing the Platform;
                </li>
                <li>
                  incite or encourage other Users (or anyone else) to engage in activity which would be unlawful in your or their jurisdictions;
                </li>
                <li>
                  be a reposting or a replication of any other User Content which we have declared to be in breach of the Community Guidelines (or any other part of our terms).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="paidForServicesSection">
          <h3>In addition, Yuzu has rules about certain kinds of User Content:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Hate Speech: We encourage free speech and recognises that some opinions and viewpoints may cause upset or offence to others. However, we will not in any circumstances tolerate speech which incites, encourages or expresses hatred to or against any ethnic, religious, gender, or other group which shares an identity characteristic.
              You must not post or upload hateful User Content. There are no exceptions to this rule.

              Your User Content is likely to be considered hateful if it encourages or wishes for violence/physical harm to a particular group of people, encourages for exclusion or segregation of a particular group of people, or if it contains slurs that are intended to degrade or dehumanize a particular group of people.
            </li>
            <li>
              Terrorism and Extremism: The Platform expressly prohibits any content which glorifies, encourages, or seeks to recruit individuals to participate in terrorism or other extremist activity. There are no exceptions to this rule.
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-Consensual and Unsolicited Sexual Material: Any sexual material which depicts images of sexual activity in which one or more participants are unwilling or unconsenting is prohibited. You must not upload it to the Platform.
              This includes sexual material in which participants are unwillingly involved, including intimate photography/video of individuals who were unaware that they were being photographed/filmed or who were unwilling to participate in that process.

              You must not send User Content which is sexual in nature to other Users who have not indicated that they wish to receive it from you by, for example, subscribing to your User Content or through direct communications. This includes intimate photography of yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Explicit Content: Explicitly sexual content is permitted on the Platform but as the Platform is used by a wide audience of people, you must flag explicitly sexual content as “18+ Content”. In addition, you must not make explicit User Content available to Users, as a Paid for Service or otherwise, if you are aware, or ought reasonably to be aware, such Users are under the age of 18. Explicit User Content without the appropriate 18+ Content marking is prohibited and you must not upload it to the Platform.
              Explicit User Content depicting, or otherwise involving, any person under the age of 18, including yourself, is prohibited. It is your responsibility to ensure that the subjects of your explicit User Content are over the age of 18 and to maintain appropriate documentation sufficient to evidence the same.

              User Content is likely to be considered explicit if it could be considered inappropriate for people under the age of 18; it contains material which is sexual or pornographic;

              Context can be important in making a determination and, in particular, content which represents factual reporting on current events is less likely to be considered explicit where it consists of newsworthy images that help individuals to properly understand the events being reported on. Likewise, images which represent artistic or stylised representations of these subjects are less likely to be considered explicit by us.
            </li>
            <li>
              Private Information: You must not disclose or publish private information about other individuals who have not consented to that publication. In particular, this 2 includes publishing the name, address, or occupation of other Users who have not chosen to make that information about themselves public.
            </li>
            <li>
              Impersonation: You must not use the Platform to impersonate other individuals in a way that is designed to mislead other Users. In particular you should not use the Platform to impersonate other Users or public figures.
              'Parody' or similar comedic use of the Platform is unlikely to infringe this rule. However, this kind of use should be clearly labelled and should be easily recognisable as such by its intended and likely audience.
