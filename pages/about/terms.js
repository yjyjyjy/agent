              are accepted, including where we accept Credits as payment. Only

              Your Account is personal to you. You may only transfer or

              This Agreement does not give rise to any rights under the

              If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations

              you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have

              have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by
